                    <p><strong>Although there's been a slight increase in female participation in science and engineering over the past two decades, there's still some work to do.</strong><br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Here's some statistics:</strong>
                        <br>
                        "Female students' achievement in mathematics and science is on par with their male peers and female students participate in high level mathematics and science courses at similar rates as their male peers, with the exception of computer science and engineering (NSF, Science & Engineering Indicators, 2018)." <br>
                        <br>
                        "The rates of science and engineering course taking for girls/women shift at the undergraduate level and gender disparities begin to emerge, especially for minority women" (NSF, Science & Engineering Indicators, 2018)."<br>
                        <br>
                        "Women remain underrepresented in the science and engineering workforce, although to a lesser degree than in the past, with the greatest disparities occurring in engineering, computer science, and the physical sciences" (NSF, Science & Engineering Indicators, 2018)." <br>
                        <br>
                        "Statistics show that women make up half of the total U.S. college-educated workforce, but only 28% of the science and engineering workforce."<br>
                        <br>
                        "Female scientists and engineers are concentrated in different occupations than are men, with relatively high shares of women in the social sciences (60%) and biological, agricultural, and environmental life sciences (48%) and relatively low shares in engineering (15%) and computer and mathematical sciences (26%)." <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>So what is the work we need to do?</strong>
                        <br>
                        The work to do involves providing exposure to young girls and women with the potential to succeed in science and engineering. From the data, we are convinced that young girls have the merit. They perform equally well with their male peers. The key is igniting a hidden passion through exposure.
                        This exposure can include mentorship, interactive field trips and hands-on learning, including continued funding for extracurricular programs. <br>
